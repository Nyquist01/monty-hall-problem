> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

By utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that sticking with your initial choice in the Monty Hall problem results in a win rate of approximately 33.33%, highlighting that it is advantageous to switch from your original choice.
